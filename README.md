### What *is* [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/)? 
Scriptable is a mobile application for iOS created to enable anyone to easily integrate with the iOS backend. Its simple syntax allows for lots of flexability. Scriptable uses *Javascript*. Scriptable allows for developers to prototype, test, preview, and much more.  

Scriptable, according to their [website](https://scriptable.app/), currently consists of the following features: 
> **Plain Javascript**

>

> - Integrate with the native APIs of iOS directly from JavaScript.  
>
> **Siri Shortcuts**
> - Run scripts from Siri Shortcuts. Present tables, websites, HTML and more in Siri.  
>

> - All native APIs that are bridged to JavaScript have documentation which is available offline.  
>
> **Share Sheet Extension**
> - Run a script from a share sheet and process the inputs.  
>
> **Files Integration**
> - Integrated with the file system and Files.app enabling you to perform operations on files.
