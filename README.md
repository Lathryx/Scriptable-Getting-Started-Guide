Scriptable is a mobile application for iOS created to enable anyone to easily integrate with the iOS backend. Its simple syntax allows for lots of flexability. Scriptable uses *Javascript*. Scriptable allows for developers to prototype, test, preview, and much more. It was developed by [Simon B. StÃ¸vring](https://simonbs.dk/), the creator of various other apps such as [Jayson](https://jayson.app/) and [Data Jar](https://datajar.app/).

Scriptable, according to their [official website](https://scriptable.app/), currently consists of the following features: 
> **Plain Javascript** 
> - Supports JavaScript ES6. Scripts are stored as plain JS files on disk.  
>
> **Native APIs**
> - Integrate with the native APIs of iOS directly from JavaScript.  
>
> **Siri Shortcuts**
> - Run scripts from Siri Shortcuts. Present tables, websites, HTML and more in Siri.  
>

>
> **Share Sheet Extension**
> - Run a script from a share sheet and process the inputs.  
>
> **Files Integration**
> - Integrated with the file system and Files.app enabling you to perform operations on files.  
>

By using Scriptable, you have the benefit of easily integrating with iOS without the need for a Developer license; it's a great tool for the average consumer, or a full-time developer.

  - Some good references for Javascript can be found on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp) or [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide). Good beginner courses can be found on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) or [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/JavaScript/?ref=app).
- Access to an iOS device. 
- iOS 14 or later.
